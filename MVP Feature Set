Abstracted biota living in an environment, suffering pressures from environment and each other.

* Biota base body
  * Genes for physical ability/expression
  * Real-Time Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) for brain/behaviours
  * Mutations for reproducton
  * Random starting state

* Program utility
  * Ability to navigate around the 2d worldspace
  * Click on individual biota to drill into genes/ brain
  * Menu for adjusting world settings/ parameters
  * Ability to examine family tree (save dead biota stats)

* Evolution pressures
  * Food sources are limited, to maintin population levels at manageable levels.
  * World is finite, to force biota to interact.

* Architecture - OOP vs ECS
  * This kind of sim works best when it can be run with many many entities
  * Compare performance with pygame and python OOP vs ECS (create test platform?)
